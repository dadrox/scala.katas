A set of junit tests that facilitate learning scala.

At this point I'm focusing on S-99 from http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/

The S-99 unit tests are in src/test/scala and packages problems.s99.a thru problems.s99.e
indicating the general order in which to approach them.

I've provided some scala classes/objects in src/main/scala where you can implement your solutions.

In the future, I plan on adding more katas as I think of them.
